```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

data(mpg)
mpg
head(mpg)


# R's basic plotting commands

hist(mpg$cty)
hist(mpg$cty, breaks=20)

plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)
plot(hwy ~ displ, data=mpg)  # works if you've loaded mosaic

boxplot(cty~class, data=mpg)


# Pros: simple syntax
# Cons: not that pretty, and very hard to do complex things

# We'll use ggplot2 instead
# Cons: commands are less intuitive at first
# Pros: much easier to make sophisticated, beautiful plots

# creating a ggplot
# The first line sets up a coordinate system.
# the second line maps displ to x, hwy to y, and draws points
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
